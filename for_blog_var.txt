*grouped data
*Data is in Stata format 
use http://www.stata-press.com/data/r14/dollhill3, clear
*poisson (should really use robust se)
poisson deaths i.smokes i.agecat,exposure(pyears) irr
predict n

*logistic (need to use glm and do own calculation of pseudo r2)
glm deaths i.agecat i.smokes, family(binomial pyears) eform
scalar F = `e(ll)'
glm deaths,  family(binomial pyears) eform
di 1 - F / e(ll)

*convert to individual level
gen alive = pyears - deaths
expand 2, gen(dead)
gen weight = deaths if dead==1
replace weight = alive if dead==0
expand weight

*poisson (again should really be robust se)
poisson dead i.smokes i.agecat, irr
*logistic
logit dead i.smokes i.agecat, or
